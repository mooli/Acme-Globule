=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # a simple plugin
 package Acme::Globule::Ping;

 sub globule {
   my($self, $pattern) = @_;
   # somebody did <ping> and so we want to return ('pong')
   return [ "pong" ] if $pattern eq 'ping';
   # they didn't ping, so pass
   return;
 }

 # a simple client
 package main;

 use Acme::Globule qw( Ping );

 # prints "pong'
 print <ping>;
 # prints the location of your home directory
 print <~>;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package extends glob (and thus <>) to return custom results. It has a
plugin mechanism and you define which plugins you wish to use on the import
line. Now when you call glob(), these plugins will be tried left-to-right
until one claims it, with a fall-through to the standard glob() function.

Each of your packages may use different plugins, and packages that do not
import Acme::Globule will get standard glob() behaviour.

=head1 Creating a plugin

To create a plugin, create a module Acme::Globule::* and provide a globule()
method. The globule method should return an array reference containing the
matches, or nothing if it wishes to decline and let the next plugin try it.

=head1 BUGS

Any code that uses this module is perverse and therefore contains at least
one bug.

This module globally hooks both File::Glob::csh_glob CORE::GLOBAL::glob, and
so using this module anywhere in a program will cause all uses of glob() to
suffer a slight performance hit even in other modules which do not use it.

glob() within an eval() will probably not do what you expect.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Acme::Globule::*, the plugins.
